## Hello there 👋. My name is Ethan Brierley.

<img align="right" alt="Animation of me" width="135" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethanboxx/ethanboxx/master/me.gif">

I am a student in the South East of England studying Computer Science, Maths, Further Maths and Physics at A-Level.

I am currently focusing on full stack 🕸️ web development. I enjoy working with Rust🦀.

Right now I am working on a full stack project as part of my computer science course in 100% Rust
(including the front-end using webassembly).

I enjoy teaching and learning from others. I work at [techresort](https://techresorteb.com/).

### Hire me.

July next year I will have finished my education and will be looking for a developer role.
If you think I could be a good fit please get in touch.
